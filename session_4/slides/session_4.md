# Modules

```python
import random
from math import floor
```

---

# Random Module

```python
import random

# Random float from 0.0 to 1.0
print random.random()

# Gets a random number between 1 and 10
number = random.randint(1, 10)
```

---

# Math Module

```python
from math import floor, ceil

number = floor(3.2) # 3
print(floor(9.99)) # 9

number = ceil(3.2) # 4
print(ceil(9.99)) # 10
```

---

# While Loops

```python
guess = None
while guess != 4:
    # Continues to ask for a number until you enter 4
    guess = int(input("What's your number? "))
```

---

# Infinite Loops

```python
while True:
    # This loops forever
    print("Hello")
```

---

# Break Statements

```python
while True:
    print("Hello")
    break
```

---

# Collections

- List
- Tuple
- Set
- Dictionary

---

# Collections — Tuple

```python
colours = ("Red", "Blue", "Green")
print(colours[0]) # Red
print(colours[1]) # Blue
print(colours[2]) # Green
```

---

# Collections — Set

```python
fruit = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}
for item in fruit:
    print(item)
```

---

# Collections — Dictionary

```python
shirt = {
    "size": "Large",
    "colour": "Red"
}

print(shirt["size"]) # Large

shirt["material"] = "Cotton" # Add new key/value pair
shirt["colour"] = "Green" # Change existing value

del(shirt["size"]) # Delete key/value pair

if "material" in shirt:
    print("The material is: " + shirt["material"])

for key in shirt:
    print(str(key) + " = " + str(shirt[key]))
```

---

# Nested Collections

```python
phone_grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9],
    ["*", 0, "#"]
]

for row in phone_grid:
    for column in row:
        print(column)
```

---

# List of Dictionaries

```python
contacts = [
    {"fname": "Alice", "lname": "Smith"},
    {"fname": "Bob", "lname": "Jones", "phone": "555-1234"},
    {"fname": "Charlie", "lname": "McCloud"}
]

for person in contacts:
    if "phone" in person:
        print(person["fname"])
```
